#= BREAKTHROUGH LIVING CLASS
#
#This is a Sunday School class web site. The membership list is closed to class members who have signed in
and been validated. Once a member signs in, they will remain signed in until they log out. Once they have signed 
in, they will be able to access the membership list, see who is involved in the various ministries, see pictures
#of the members, and leave messages.

# The site has two parts --
#* The public view
#* The membership view

#The public has access to the initial title page, the videos, the events page, and the list of ministries.

#The membership has access to the same pages as the public, but also has access to:
#* The membership list
#* The ministries list, with members names
#* The forum area
	
#Membership access is controlled with digitally coded passwords. The actual password is not stored
#within the database. Instead, we use a seed code that, when combined with the user's password, 
#creates the access code for the member.

#All questions should be sent to blc@bucklandlaw.com.
